# PK with different doses
(English) Language: R // Author: Aramis Adriana Rojas Mena & Elisabet Castro Blanco

## Description
The database chosen is the blood pharmacokinetic values for an undetermined drug P and one of the metabolites M that are generated endogenously in the body of a person (without specifying the physiognomy or pathology that he/she may have).
It has been obtained from this server from a repository of databases from different phases of drug research, provided by the researcher Thomas E. Bradstreet, from the School of Mathematics at John Carroll University (USA) (http://webserv.jcu.edu/math//faculty/TShort/Bradstreet/index.html).
The pharmacokinetic values studied are the AUC (area under the curve), which gives an idea of the bioavailability of a substance in blood, either discrete (a specific point in time can be considered) or continuous (from time 0 to infinity), and the Cmax (maximum concentration in blood), for that substance.
Both values are used to characterise the kinetic behaviour of the substance in the body, i.e. the speed with which the drug P diffuses through the body with the blood and could reach the therapeutic targets, more or less non-specifically (a factor that depends on the type of drug and target cells, but is a broader concept), as well as the speed and amount of drug remaining once the elimination of the drug from the body is initiated.
In the database used, both values are presented as discrete, taken at an unspecified point in time, presumably to facilitate data processing. This is not the form that can provide the most pharmacokinetic information, but it is an assumption that is considered correct in the scientific community.
The reason for choosing such a database is due to the common interest of both authors in the behaviour of a drug/substance in a living animal organism, thus bringing together two separate scientific fields, with Elisabet as a biologist and Aramis as a pharmacist.
